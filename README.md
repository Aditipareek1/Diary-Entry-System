# Diary-Entry-System

It's just like a blog application. but here it's intended as a place where users can write there diaries. And there entries are safe since a log in system is also there.

This application is primarily made with the help of Swing that is a Java graphical user interface (GUI).
For database I've used MySQL Workbench.
